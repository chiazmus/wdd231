# Site Plan
---
**Site Name**:
guildofadventurers.org, or something similar.  I'll name it this because it's going to be a fictional site for the "guild of adventurers".
**Site Purpose**:
This site will be a place for all eager adventurers to find places wherein they may adventure, and parties that may be lacking an adventurer!  It will provide the information of the different dungeons and locations to visit, along with their various risk levels, and rewards.  It will also provide a list of parties currently seeking adventurers, and allow the adventurer to sign up for one of the parties, or to create one.
**Scenarios**:
- Where can I go to get started with adventuring?
- Where can I find a mage for my fledgling party so we don't get massacred by orcs?
- How can I join the Guild of Adventurers?
